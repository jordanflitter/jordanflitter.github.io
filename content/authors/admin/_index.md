## Who

Hello there! I am a postdoc researcher at [Scuola Normale Superiore](http://cosmology.sns.it/index.html) in Pisa, Italy. As you can read more about below, I'm into physics beyond the standard model, this includes both particle physics but mainly cosmology. Currently, I'm taking part in the [21cmFAST](https://github.com/21cmfast/21cmFAST) development team as my research focuses on studying the cosmological 21cm signal. I'm always happy to collaborate and discuss new ideas, so if you share the same interests you are very welcomed to [reach out](mailto:jordan.flitter@sns.it)!
